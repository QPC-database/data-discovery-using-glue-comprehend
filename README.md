## Simplify Data Discovery for Business Users using AWS Glue and Amazon Comprehend

This Github repository is created to provide the sample source for the AWS blog post- Simplify Data Discovery for Business Users using AWS Glue and Amazon Comprehend

*In this blog post we will discuss how to bridge the gap between cross-functional data producer teams sometimes also known as Domain Data Experts and business focused consumer teams known for authoring BI reports and dashboards.*
*By allowing BI Authors who are using* *Amazon QuickSight* (https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) *to search and discover data stored in* *AWS data lake storage Amazon S3* (https://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/data-lake-storage/)*, Through* *Amazon Athena* (https://aws.amazon.com/athena/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc) *BI Authors can access metadata stored in* *AWS Glue Data Catalog* (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/populate-data-catalog.html)*, in addition to a simple column-level data description powered by** **Amazon Comprehend** AI* (https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) *for automatically detected data-entities, while using* *Amazon Comprehend* *custom recognition* (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/custom-entity-recognition.html) *where data descriptions are labelled by Domain Experts through **Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth* (https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/) *for the unidentified data-entities.*
